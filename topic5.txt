1. Get bus.sql from Moodle and import it into MySQL.
Done

2. How are the tables in the database related?
busReg in driver is linked to reg in bus

3. Add the following drivers:
“Mary”
INSERT into driver (name) VALUES ("Mary");


“Bob” – licence number “RN2423”
INSERT into driver (name, licenceNo) VALUES ("Bob", "RN2423");

“Sean” – licence number “FF88345” who drives bus “191-G-123”
INSERT into driver (name, licenceNo, busReg) VALUES ("Sean", "FF88345", "191-G-123");

What happens and why?
4. Add the following buses:
"12-G-1323" that can hold up to 34 passengers and runs on "Diesel"
Duplicate entry for reg

"171-G-885" that can hold up to 84 passengers and runs on "Petrol"
INSERT INTO `bus`(`reg`, `maxPassengers`, `fuel`) VALUES ('171-G-885', '84', 'Petrol');

"191-D-45890" that can hold up to 120 passengers and runs on "Ethanol"
INSERT INTO `bus`(`reg`, `maxPassengers`, `fuel`) VALUES ('191-D-45890', '120', 'Ethanol');
 Warning: #1265 Data truncated for column 'fuel' at row 1

 Because Describe bus shows the allowed entries are Diesel, Petrol and Electric


What happens and why?
5. Update driver’s licences that contain the letters “F” or “R” to have the letters “T-“ before 
their current licence number.
UPDATE driver 
update driver
set licenceNo = CONCAT("T-",licenceNo)
where licenceNo like "%F%"
or licenceNo like "%R%";

6. Delete driver “Alan”. What happens and why?
Delete from driver Where name = "Alan";

7. Delete bus “161-d-1323”. What happens and why?
Delete from bus Where reg = "161-d-1323";

8. Get bus2.sql from Moodle and import it into MySQL. To use this database type use bus2;

9. Delete bus “161-d-1323”. What happens and why?

10. Get employees2.sql from Moodle and import it into MySQL. To use this database type use 
employees2;

11. Show the emp_no, first_name and last_name of employees born in the average year.
The average year should be rounded down to the nearest whole number. For example,
• 1949.1 becomes 1949.
• 1949.9 becomes 1949.
• 1949.0 becomes 1949.

select emp_no, first_name, last_name from employees
where year(birth_date) = (
select floor(avg(year(birth_date))) from employees
);
12. Show the emp_no, first_name, last_name and name of the department each employee is in
select distinct e.emp_no, e.first_name, e.last_name, d.name
from employees e
inner join salaries s
 on e.emp_no = s.emp_no
inner join dept d
 on s.dept_no = d.dept_no
